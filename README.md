### Introduction
In 2014, Xinjie Di, an SCPD student from Apple Inc. submitted a paper which focused on predicting stock price trend for a company in the near future. The feature space was derived from the time series of the stock itself and was concerned with potential movement of past price. Tree algorithm was applied to feature selection and it suggests a subset of stock technical indicators are critical for predicting the stock trend.

Experiment results suggested a accuracy of more than 70% onn predicting 3-10 day average price trend with SVM algorithm.
